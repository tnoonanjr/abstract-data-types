# Abstract Data Type Library (ADTs)
A collection of ADTs with extensive (and perhaps a bit exhaustive) docstrings and comments to ensure full comprehension. 

## Mission Statement
  I opened this repository to provide benchmark abstract data types with most expected attributes and methods. Its main function is to serve as a refresher on data structures I am already familiar with but have forgotten the atomic details of each individual line. Nevertheless, my hope is that these notes will help others to acreete knowledge on these topics more rapidly than putting their noses to a grindstone in a textbook. Each file is meticulously docstringed and commented to confirm readers fully appreciate every line of code. It is a tad overboard for the intermediate coder but each method is partitoned off so that one can hone in on what they are yet to understand. 

## Bottom line
Feel free to use my documents to study, brainstorm a LeetCode solution, or find an structural optimization for your creative projects. Thank you for reading and remember to trust the process!
